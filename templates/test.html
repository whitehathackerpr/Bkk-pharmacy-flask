        <h2>Official Notice: Freeze of Bank Accounts and Assets</h2>
        <p>Dear <strong>Akandwanaho Ivan</strong> (also known as Alvin),</p>
        <p>We regret to inform you that, effective immediately, all your bank accounts and assets have been frozen due to your involvement in unauthorized financial activities. The accounts that have been affected include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>American Bank</li>
            <li>Kenyan Commercial Bank (KCB)</li>
            <li>ABSA</li>
            <li>Equity Bank</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, all other assets registered under your name will also be subject to seizure.</p>
        <p>This action has been taken due to your assistance in facilitating the illegal transfer of funds out of Russia. A payment of <span class="highlight">USD 1.8 million</span> has been traced back to you, and it has been confirmed that a total of <span class="highlight">USD 31 million</span> was transferred under your facilitation.</p>
        <p>Legal proceedings are being prepared, and you will be summoned to court in due course. You will be informed of further developments shortly.</p>
        <p>If you wish to discuss this matter, please contact the relevant authorities.</p>

        <div class="footer">
            <p>Best regards,</p>
